The dark theme is perfect for those late-night coding sessions when you want to reduce eye strain. The light theme is great for daytime use or when you&#39;re in a well-lit room. You can switch between them anytime - it&#39;s all about what feels right for your eyes and your environment.</p><h2 id="fonts" tabindex="-1">Fonts <a class="header-anchor" href="#fonts" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Fonts&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We&#39;ve set Geist and Geist Mono as our default fonts because they look great and are super readable. But hey, we know everyone has their own font preferences! That&#39;s why we&#39;ve included a bunch of other options:</p><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Outfit (our default)</td><td>Space Grotesk</td></tr><tr><td>Inter</td><td>Geist</td></tr><tr><td>Roboto</td><td>Jakarta</td></tr><tr><td>Poppins</td><td>System</td></tr><tr><td>Montserrat</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>You can change your font anytime in the settings. We&#39;ve picked these fonts because they&#39;re not just pretty - they&#39;re also optimized to look great on any screen size and load quickly.</p><h2 id="languages" tabindex="-1">Languages <a class="header-anchor" href="#languages" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Languages&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Nixopus speaks your language!

We&#39;re working on adding more languages to make Nixopus accessible to everyone around the world.</p><p>Want to help make Nixopus speak your language? We&#39;re looking for native speakers to help us translate and make the experience more authentic. If you&#39;re fluent in a language and want to contribute, we&#39;d love to have you on board! Together, we can make Nixopus feel more human and less like a machine translation.</p>',13)]))}const f=t(o,[["render",s]]);export{p as __pageData,f as default};
