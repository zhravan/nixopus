## Story Behind Nixopus
Nixopus is a project that was started in 2024 by [Raghav](https://github.com/raghavyuva) to solve the problem of the complexity of managing a VPS. At that time, We were frustrated with the current solutions available. They were either too expensive or too difficult to use. We knew that there had to be a better way. So we decided to take matters into our own hands and create a solution that would be both user-friendly and free.

After months of hard work, Nixopus was born. It is a solution that is both user-friendly and free. It is also customizable, scalable, secure, and well-documented. It is a solution that is driven by the community and is open-source. It is a solution that is easy to use and allows users to customize it to suit their needs.
