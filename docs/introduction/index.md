# Introduction

Nixopus is your all-in-one solution for managing the VPS. While "managing the VPS" is a broad term, we will elaborate on its specific applications for marketing purposes. In a nutshell, our aim with Nixopus is to create software that can help you provide tools to manage your vps.

Nixopus draws inspiration from various existing solutions in the market, with [Coolify](https://coolify.io/) being one notable example. Our goal is to create a platform that meets the diverse and sophisticated needs of developers, who constantly push the boundaries of what's possible with their innovative thinking and technical expertise.

## Why Nixopus?

In today's software landscape, feature bloat often leads to cluttered and confusing interfaces. We recognize that developers are users too, and they deserve a superior experience. Nixopus takes a different approach - instead of stacking features, we focus on creating elegant software that appears simple on the surface while hiding **powerful capabilities** beneath.

While many excellent software solutions exist, each with their own strengths, we choose not to directly compare Nixopus with other solutions. Instead, we believe that true value comes from user engagement and community feedback. Our philosophy is simple: we invite you to explore Nixopus, share your experiences, and help shape its future. We understand that no software is perfect - there's always room for improvement, and it's the user's perspective that truly matters in making something great.

## Nixopus Stability

Nixopus is currently in active development, and we're working towards our first stable release. During this phase, you may encounter occasional feature updates and improvements. We value your feedback and encourage you to report any issues you encounter as we work together to make Nixopus more robust and reliable.
