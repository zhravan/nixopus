# Marketplace

## Introduction

Nixopus makes it easy to host open source projects on your own server with one click. Imagine a store like the `Play Store` or `App Store` where you can easily search, install, and manage open source projects without having to worry about complicated configuration. That's what we've created with the Nixopus Marketplace.

With the Nixopus Marketplace, you can quickly [find](#list-of-available-projects) and install open source projects with just one click. You can also easily uninstall them whenever you want, and monitor their logs and details. We've made it as simple as possible to host and manage open source projects on your own server.

## Installing Open Source Projects

The Nixopus Marketplace is a directory of open source projects that you can easily install on your own server. To install a project, click on the project you want to install from the marketplace section in the sidebar. Then, simply click the "Install" button. The project will be installed and you can view the install logs and status right below. Once installed, you can uninstall the project, view the logs, or even monitor the container statistics.
