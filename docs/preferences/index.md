# Preferences
Your preferences matter to us. That's why we've made it easy to customize your experience with themes, fonts, and languages - all available in the settings menu.

## Themes
Nixopus gives you the choice between dark and light themes. The dark theme is perfect for those late-night coding sessions when you want to reduce eye strain. The light theme is great for daytime use or when you're in a well-lit room. You can switch between them anytime - it's all about what feels right for your eyes and your environment.

## Fonts
We've set Geist and Geist Mono as our default fonts because they look great and are super readable. But hey, we know everyone has their own font preferences! That's why we've included a bunch of other options:

| | |
|--------|--------|
| Outfit  (our default) | Space Grotesk |
| Inter | Geist |
| Roboto | Jakarta |
| Poppins | System |
| Montserrat | |

You can change your font anytime in the settings. We've picked these fonts because they're not just pretty - they're also optimized to look great on any screen size and load quickly.

## Languages
Nixopus speaks your language! We currently support:
- English (default)
- Spanish
- French
- Kannada
- Malayalam

You can switch languages anytime in the settings. We're working on adding more languages to make Nixopus accessible to everyone around the world.

Want to help make Nixopus speak your language? We're looking for native speakers to help us translate and make the experience more authentic. If you're fluent in a language and want to contribute, we'd love to have you on board! Together, we can make Nixopus feel more human and less like a machine translation.
