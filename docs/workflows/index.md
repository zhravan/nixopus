  1. Checkout repository  
  2. Log in to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)  
  3. Build Docker images (API + Web UI)  
  4. Push images to GHCR  
- **Secrets/Dependencies:** `GITHUB_TOKEN` (ensure `permissions: packages: write`) or a PAT with `write:packages` if publishing from a fork or across orgs.
- Example (in the workflow):
    - permissions:
        contents: read
        packages: write

- **Link:** [Workflow file](https://github.com/raghavyuva/nixopus/blob/master/.github/workflows/docs.yml)  

---

### 4. `format.yaml`
- **Description:** Runs code formatters (`gofmt` for the API, Prettier for the frontend and a formatting task for the CLI) on pushes to `master` or `feat/develop` and auto-commits any changes.  
- **Why:** Enforces consistent code style across all components.  
- **Executed Flow:**  
  1. Checkout repository  
  2. Run `gofmt` on API code  
  3. Run `prettier` on frontend code  
  4. Run formatter on CLI  
  5. Auto-commit changes (if any)  
  - Note: use a commit message containing `[skip ci]` and/or guard with
    `if: github.actor != 'github-actions[bot]'`, plus `concurrency:` to avoid commit loops.
  - Requires `permissions: contents: write`.
- **Link:** [Workflow file](https://github.com/raghavyuva/nixopus/blob/master/.github/workflows/format.yaml)  

---

### 5. `labeler.yml`
- **Description:** Applies predefined labels to pull requests using `actions/labeler` when a PR is opened, synchronized or reopened.  
- **Why:** Automates PR labeling to simplify triage.  
- **Executed Flow:**  
  1. PR opened/sync/reopen triggers workflow  
  2. Load `.github/labeler.yml` rules  
  3. Apply matching labels to PR  
- **Dependencies:** `.github/labeler.yml` configuration file.  
- **Permissions:** `permissions: pull-requests: write`.
- **Link:** [Workflow file](https://github.com/raghavyuva/nixopus/blob/master/.github/workflows/labeler.yml)  

---

### 6. `release-cli.yml`
- **Description:** Builds and packages the CLI component (using Poetry and fpm) into various package formats on pushes or pull requests touching the `cli` directory, and then creates a release artifact.  
- **Why:** Produces distributable CLI packages for multiple environments.  
- **Executed Flow:**  
  1. Checkout repository  
  2. Install Python + Poetry  
  3. Build CLI packages (`.deb`, `.rpm`, etc.) with `fpm`  
  4. Upload release artifacts to GitHub Releases  
- **Artifacts:** Release artifacts uploaded to GitHub Releases.  
- **Secrets/Permissions:** `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `permissions: contents: write` (and any signing keys/envs if packages are signed).
- **Link:** [Workflow file](https://github.com/raghavyuva/nixopus/blob/master/.github/workflows/release-cli.yml)  

---

### 7. `release.yml`
- **Description:** Uses changelog action to generate a prerelease tag and create a GitHub pre-release whenever code is pushed to `master` or triggered manually.  
- **Why:** Provides prerelease builds for early testing.  
- **Executed Flow:**  
  1. Checkout repository  
  2. Generate changelog  
  3. Create prerelease tag  
  4. Publish GitHub prerelease

### 9. `test.yaml`
- **Description:** Executes Go unit tests on pushes to `master` or `feat/develop` branches.  
- **Why:** Maintains code correctness and prevents regressions.  
- **Executed Flow:**  
  1. Checkout repository  
  2. Set up Go environment  
  3. Run `go test ./...`

## 🔑 Secrets & Environment Variables
Workflows may rely on:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` → default GitHub token with repo access.
- For actions that write (releases, labels, packages), set workflow/job `permissions:` explicitly (e.g., `contents: write`, `pull-requests: write`, `packages: write`).
- Prefer `GITHUB_TOKEN` for registry pushes and labeling (set minimal `permissions`).
- `CODERABBIT_API_KEY` → for Coderabbit integration.
- Other repository secrets as defined in `Settings > Secrets and variables`.
Notes:
- Avoid Personal Access Tokens unless necessary; scope minimally and rotate regularly.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Workflows
- **Check Logs:** Review detailed logs under the GitHub Actions tab.  
- **Rerun:** Use the “Re-run jobs” option if a transient error occurs.  
- **Secrets:** Ensure required secrets are set in repository settings.  
- **Permissions:** Verify tokens have the required scopes (e.g., `package:write` for GHCR).  
- **Workflow permissions:** Check `permissions:` at workflow/job level (defaults can be read-only).
- **Concurrency/loops:** Ensure auto-commit workflows avoid re-trigger loops (`[skip ci]`, actor guard, `concurrency:`).
